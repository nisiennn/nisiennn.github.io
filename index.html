	<title>UCAT University Suggester</title>
    UCAT Univerisity Predictor
</h1>
<p>A program designed to help you choose what universities you should be looking at according to your UCAT score.</p>

<a href="https://www.ucat.ac.uk/">UCAT Website</a>

<p>The UCAT is an electronic examination which includes multiple choice questions for students applying for medical or dental degrees in universities. 36 Universities across the UK take in scores from the SUAT to assist them in selecting applicants, including Oxford, Imperial and Cambridge. The exam is scored between <strong> 1200-3600 </strong> where students get a score out of 900 in 4 different criterias. A really good UCAT score can heavily assist students in aquiring the top universities in the country for medicine.</p>
